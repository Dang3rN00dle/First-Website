<h2><font color="green"><u>Installing the Python Software</u></font></h2>
<text>The first thing you will want to do is install the official python software from <b><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python.org</a></b><b><font color="orange">(NOTE: The website should automatically detect your OS, so if you use either one of those, just click the big<br>
    yellow button that says "Download Python 3.9.2", and it should begin to install.)</font></b>, which will automatically give you 3 programs: <b>The python IDLE, "Python 3.9(64-bit)", and the "Python 3.9<br>
    manuals(64-bit)".</b> You, if I am not mistaken, should be asked how you would like to install the program(s), so just click the top option to easily install it. You can use this "Python IDLE" perfectly fine, but if you want to get the functionality of a python console and other things, you might want to follow the next step:</text>
<br>
<h2><font color="green"><u>Installing Pycharm</u></font></h2>
<text>Installing Pycharm is super easy, so this shouldn't take long.<br>
First, you will want to go to the <b><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows">Pycharm Download Page</a></b>, and click the <b>"Community Download"</b> button(it should be the black button). Once the package is done installing, you will want to click on it,<br>
    and minimize the browser(if you don't see the setup wizard). Just follow the setup wizard instructions:<br>
    <font color="gray">Click next -> if you want, you can change the install location, but that is up to you. Just click next again once you are okay with the install location -> Choose what launcher you have(32-bit or 64-bit) and<br>
        whether or not you would like to install the "JRE x86 by JetBrains"(again it's up to you) then click next -> Then just click on the "Install" button, and it will start installing.</font><br>
    It will most likely ask you if you want to import custom settings from previous Pycharm installations, but you most likely won't have any, so just check "Do not import settings", and click "OK". After that<br>
    just read and accept the licence terms and conditions thing, click "Don't Send" on the next screen-thing, and Pycharm will launch.
